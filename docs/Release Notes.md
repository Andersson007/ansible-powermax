Known issues
------------
- Modify state operation from Establish to Suspend in Adaptive Copy mode in presence of force flag is not implemented. 
  The REST API does not support this hence Python SDK (PyU4V) has no support for this operation.
  
- Task to link a snapshot to a target storage group which is already linked is not implemented.
  The REST API does not support this hence Python SDK (PyU4V) has no support for this operation.

- Using automation, when the user tries to create a host with invalid initiators, an empty host is created even though it generates an error. However, when a modify scenario is run on this host without a pause, it generates an error saying "The requested host resource already exists.". Workaround is to add a pause(~20) between the two tasks.

Limitations
-----------
There are no known limitations.
