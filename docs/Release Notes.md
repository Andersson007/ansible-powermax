> **NOTE:** Unisphere Version 9.1 is compatible with PowerMax Python
> library version 9.1.x.x and similarly Unisphere versions later than 9.1 will
> only work with Python library versions later than 9.1.x.x.

Known issues
------------
- Using automation, when the user tries to create a host with invalid initiators, an empty host is created even though it generates an error. However, when a modify scenario is run on this host without a pause, it generates an error saying "The requested host resource already exists.". Workaround is to add a pause(~20) between the two tasks.

Limitations
-----------
There are no known limitations.
