Known issues
------------
- When the user tries to create a host with invalid initiators using automation, an empty host is created despite generating an error. However, when a modify scenario is run on this host without a pause, it generates an error saying "The requested host resource already exists.". A workaround is to add a pause(~20) between the two tasks.

Limitations
-----------
There are no known limitations.
